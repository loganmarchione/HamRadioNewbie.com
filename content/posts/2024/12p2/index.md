## Introduction

This post is all about the legal mumbo-jumbo around getting licensed.

## Licensing

No, not this kind of license.

## The FCC

There are some country-by-country rules, but generally, all ham radio frequencies are the same over the globe.

### Post Office Box

When you get licensed, your name and address will go into a public FCC database. In fact, on [this page](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchAdvanced.jsp), you can search for registered hams near you (select *Amateur* from the Service Group, then *HA* from the box, then enter your ZIP code).

{{< img src="20241022_001.png" alt="fcc database search" >}}

If you don't want spam from having your information exposed (like WHOIS domain privacy or voter registration), you can rent a [Post Office (PO) Box](https://www.usps.com/manage/po-boxes.htm) from your local Post Office (just prepare to pay about $100/yr for the smallest size).

### FRN

You'll need to register with the FCC to [get your FCC Registration Number (FRN)](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/knowledge-base/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/getting-fcc-registration). You will need this later when you take your exam.

If you want a PO Box, you should get that setup *before* you create your FRN. The reason is that if you switch to a PO Box after you get your license, someone could go through your license history and find your old address.

### The exam

VCE

* Technician
    * 35 multiple-choice questions (must get 26 correct)
    * grants access to all ham bands above 30MHz and some high-frequency bands
* General
    * requires Technician license
    * 35 multiple-choice questions (must get 26 correct)
    * grants access to all ham bands
* Extra
    * requires General license
    * 50 multiple-choice questions (must get 37 correct)

Technician radio generally allows use of light-of-sight communication and repeaters. If you want to refract your signal off of the atmosphere, you need to use lower frequencies, which requires the General license.

## The rules

[Part 97 of the FCC rules](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-97) govern the rules of ham radio. A few key things to point out are below.

* Identify yourself by callsign at the end of every communication and once every 10 minutes (this must be done in English)
* Non-commercial use only
* Avoid interference and use the minimum power necessary
* No swearing
* No encryption
* No broadcasting music
* Even though your radio *can* work on FRS/CB/GMRS bands, you shouldn't use it for that (you should buy a separate radio for that)
* Ham radio can be used without a license in an emergency

### FRS vs. CB vs. MURS vs. GMRS vs. ham

With ham radio, the person is licensed, not the radio. For FRS and CB, the manufacturers of radios need to submit their designs to the FCC for approval. That's why you don't need a license to use these radios (because the license is already part of the radio you purchased). However, MURS, GMRS, and ham all need licenses.
