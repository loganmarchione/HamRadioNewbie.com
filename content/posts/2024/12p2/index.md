## Licensing

No, not this kind of license.

Listening is free

The person is licensed, not the radio.

## The FCC

There are some country-by-country rules, but generally, all ham radio frequencies are the same over the globe.

### Get a PO Box

Get a Post Office (PO) Box.

### The exam

VCE

* Technician
    * 35 multiple-choice questions (must get 26 correct)
    * grants access to all amateur bands above 30MHz and some high-frequency bands
* General
    * requires Technician license
    * 35 multiple-choice questions (must get 26 correct)
    * grants access to all amateur bands
* Extra
    * requires General license
    * 50 multiple-choice questions (must get 37 correct)

Technician radio generally allows use of light-of-sight communication and repeaters. If you want to refract your signal off of the atmosphere, you need to use lower frequencies, which requires the General license.

## The rules

[Part 97 of the FCC rules](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-97) govern the rules of amateur radio. A few key things to point out are below.

* Identify yourself by callsign at the end of every communication and once every 10 minutes (this must be done in English)
* Non-commercial use only
* Avoid interference and use the minimum power necessary
* No swearing
* No encryption
* No broadcasting music
* Even though your radio *can* work on FRS/CB/GMRS bands, you shouldn't use it for that (you should buy a separate radio for that)
* Amateur radio can be used without a license in an emergency
