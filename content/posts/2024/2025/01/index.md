## Introduction

Finally, after all this time, we're getting to the good part: buying hardware!

## Form factors

Radios comes in a few form factors, depending on what you need them to do.

### Handheld transceiver (HT)

As the name implies, these are handheld devices. They typically max out at around 5 watts of transmit power. They typically have a detachable antenna and are battery-powered.

### Mobile transceiver (MT)

Mobile transceivers are slightly larger units that are meant to be mounted in a vehicle with an external antenna. They are typically powered by a vehicle's 12v system and max out at around 50 watts of transmit power.

Some units have a separate screen so that the radio can be mounted out of the way and only the screen needs to be mounted in front of the user.

### Base station

Base stations are the largest units with the most advanced features. They are meant for indoor use combined with a outdoor antenna. They plug into a standard wall outlet and can typically transmit at around 100 watts of power or more.

## Radio recommendations

### GMRS

GMRS radios all tend to have the same basic features (channels, privacy codes, NOAA weather alerts, etc...), with the only differences being battery composition (Ni‚ÄìMH vs Li-ion), waterproofing level, etc... Basically, it comes down to a decision of how tough you need your radio to be. Below are some GMRS radios that seem to be recommended.

### About Chinese radios

I have read online to avoid the cheaper Chinese radios (e.g., Baofeng/BTECH Talkpod, Tidradio etc...). While they do work, they apparently tend to break easily, do not have safe batteries, and might transmit on frequencies other than the ones specified (called spurious emissions). That said, if you can't afford to spend a lot of money, the [Baofeng UV-5X](https://www.baofengradio.com/collections/uv-series/products/uv-5x) (GMRS) and the [Baofeng UV-5R](https://www.baofengradio.com/products/uv-5r) (ham) seem to be the most recommended. Just remember, you get what you pay for ü§∑üèª.

## Accessories

You could go crazy with accessories, but the first two categories to look into are antennas and batteries.

### Antennas

Typically, the stock antennas are fine, but an upgraded antenna will get you more range. Just keep in mind what bands your radio uses when you're buying an antenna. Some companies below are recommended.

 * [Signal Stick](https://signalstuff.com/shop/) (this company supports [HamStudy.org](https://hamstudy.org/))
 * [Diamond antennas](https://www.diamondantenna.net/)
 * [Comet antennas](https://cometantenna.com/)
 * [Smiley Antenna](https://www.smileyantenna.com/)

### Batteries

Your batteries are the consumable item when dealing with radios, so you should work out a plan to increase battery life. Keep the following things in mind.

* Most radios have removable battery packs, so you can purchase extra batteries (be careful for knock-off batteries)
* Some radios have an adapter to convert AA or AAA batteries onto the radio
* Some radios have a 12v adapter
* Some radios allow charging while in use, some don't

### Speaker-mic

A speaker-mic is a plug-in device that gives you a handheld speaker+microphone combo, allowing you to store the radio away in a pouch and clip the speaker-mic onto your belt/shirt/etc...

## What did I purchase

I purchased the items below. I chose the Yaesu VX-6R because it had the extra band, uses Li-ion batteries, and is waterproof. I guess time will tell if it was worth the extra $100 over the FT-60R ü§∑üèª.

| Item                                                                                | Quantity | Price | Comments                                                                                |

As time goes on, I'll probably end up purchasing these extra parts as well.
