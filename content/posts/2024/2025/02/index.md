## Introduction

## The wilderness protocol

If you are out in the field and outside of repeater range, in order to save radio battery power (you can't leave your radio on all day), it is recommended to use what is called [the wilderness protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_silence#Amateur_radio_Wilderness_Protocol). This involves announcing your presence on 146.520MHz for five minutes at the top of every third hour from 7am-7pm.

* 0700am
* 1000am
* 0100pm
* 0400pm
* 0700pm

Script goes like this:

* Give callsign
* Say "monitoring for wilderness protocol or emergency traffic"
* Wait for five minutes
* Repeat every three hours

## The rules

No swearing

No encryption
